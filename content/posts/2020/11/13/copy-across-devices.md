## Windows to Windows

If you have multiple windows devices, it's very easy. Simply open your control panel and search for _Clipboard Settings_.

Once opened, set the **Sync across devices** option to on. If you want to prevent sensitive data to be synced and do it on a case by case basis, set the **Never automatically sync text that I copy** option to on instead.

While you're at it, turn clipboard history on too to have a beautiful clipboard history available by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>.

### Use the copied text

Now if you copy something into your clipboard, based on assuming you wanted to sync everything, simply paste, or open your clipboard history on the target device to see it.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you selected never automatically sync option, you can press <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to open up your clipboard history and select what you want to be synced across your devices after copying the items.

## Mac to Mac

If you're a Mac user and want to achieve the same, you can use the [Universal Clipboard](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT209460#:~:text=On%20your%20Mac%3A%20Choose%20Apple,Handoff%2C%20then%20turn%20on%20Handoff.).

It's really simple, like we saw on windows setup.

## Windows/Mac/Linux to Mac/Windows/Linux
