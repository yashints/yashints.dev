Today I started to install Xamarin and create a pet project for myself. While doing so I faced a couple of issues and solved them using a couple of hints from SO which are worth sharing so other new starters like me can fix them quicker than me.

<!--more-->

## Android emulator opens, but project does not deploy and start

This happens specially using VS `new > project > run` combination. You will see that it builds and everything is fine, however, the emulator starts and your application will appear/not appear at all and drop quickly afterwards. You will most likely get a message like:

[[danger]]
|Android application is debugging. Could not connect to the debugger.

And also you might face this message in console:

[[danger]]
|AOT module 'mscorlib.dll.so' not found: dlopen failed: library "/data/app/<your app name>.Droid-1/lib/x86/libaot-mscorlib.dll.so" not found.

The latter is easy to fix, you just need to open the emulator settings dialog and clear the `Use Fast Deployment` checkbox.

The former is happening because of a very stupid option inside hyper-v and you can fix it by opening the hyper-v and from device selection choose your emulator. After that click on settings and navigate to `processor > Compatibility`, then tick the **Migrate to a physical computer with a different processor version** and you should be good to give it a go.

## Missing Files inside AppData\Local\Xamarin Folders

This one happened to me after running the universal Xamarin installer and finishing the steps in visual studio to create a new Xamarin forms project and click build.

By this time I was getting different error messages like:

[[danger]]
|Could not find mudule xxx in 'Xamarin.Android.Support.Design'

or

[[danger]]
|Could not find mudule xxx in 'Xamarin.Android.Support.v4'

or any of the following folders:

[[danger]]
| Xamarin.Android.Support.Design <br/>
| Xamarin.Android.Support.v4 <br/>
| Xamarin.Android.Support.v7.AppCompat <br/>
| Xamarin.Android.Support.v7.CardView <br/>
| Xamarin.Android.Support.v7.MediaRouter <br/>
| Xamarin.Android.Support.v7.RecyclerView <br/>

The reason (most probable) is failing in download a file called `android_m2repository_r10.zip` from the google repository. However that is not always the case. For any reason the fix is completely the same.

### Automatic Fix

Delete the versioned library folder that is giving you errors:

**Mac Directory:** `/Users/[Username]/.local/share/Xamarin/{SUPPORT LIBRARY NAME}/{VERSION NUMBER}`

**Windows Directory:** `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Xamarin\{SUPPORT LIBRARY NAME}\{VERSION NUMBER}`

Rebuild your project (Which will kickoff a Build Task to re-download the library).

### Manual Fix

There are two steps to manually fixing this error.

1. Adding the `m2repository` folder to the `/content` folder.
2. Adding the respective Android Support Library / Google Play Services `.aar` contents to the `/embedded` folder.

You can follow the instruction mentioned on Xamarin troubleshooting guide [here](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/troubleshooting/resolving-library-installation-errors/) to fully resolve the issue.

However the short version is:

- Get the `URL` of the missing m2repository download
- Use a `MD5` hash on the download URL from the given table
- Rename the file to `{MD5HASH}.zip` (Where MD5HASH is the hashed download URL)
- Place the new hashed .zip file in your `Xamarin\zips` directory

Hope this helps you save some time.
