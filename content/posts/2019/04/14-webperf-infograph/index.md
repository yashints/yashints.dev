A while back, Nick Galov from [Hostingtribunal.com](https://hostingtribunal.com) contacted me to let me know they had created an inforgraphic photo for web performance statistics.

This infographic contains some very useful statistics regarding page load time and some advice on where to focus for improvements.

This was after I'd given my talk on web performance at [NDC Sydney](https://ndcsydney.com/talk/need-for-speed-8-performance-tuning-of-your-web-application/), so the timing was really good.

# What happened

I got so busy during the last couple of months that I rarely blogged and more was focused on my talk for [NDC Porto](https://ndcporto.com/talk/need-for-speed-8-performance-tuning-of-your-web-application/).

# What next

Here you go, this is the infographic promised to be published on my blog. Hope this helps people find their motive to move towards a faster web.
